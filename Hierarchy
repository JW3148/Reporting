What is the use of hierarchy?
A hint to reporting tool

it will improve the performance of aggregation
  e.g. year, quarter, month. 
    if you know the sales for different quarters, and you want to know the sales at year level,
    naturally, you will aggregtion the quarters for each year to get the year level data,
    rather than aggragate from the month or day level
    
    This is humen knowledge, however, computer doesn't know, in order to tell computer it can do something like this
    you need to explicite define hierarchies
    
Attribute Relationship - Flexible vs Rigid
  e.g. two attribute Department and group. Department is formed by group. say Actural Dev support changed to IT from Actuarial
  before the change, IT has ADS, after, it's gone. This is a change in Hierarchy. In this case, we say the attribute relationship is
  flexible
  e.g. to determine f or r, ask the question, for a particular product category, if the product it contains gonna change? is it possible any new
  prod adding into this category? is it possible a product under this category being classifed as another category later?
  if yes, then flexible
  
  
In SSAS, when you define a hierarchy, it is recommended that you also define Attribute relationship
This affect cute processing, Rigid h is not processed. Since the h is not gonna change
